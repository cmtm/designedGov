== Abstract

This project is an attempt at creating a system with accomplishes two things:

* Give individuals and organizations (users) better access to their own information.

* Replace the current tedious, complex, error-prone and dangerous way of moving this information around with one that is simple, safe and automatable.

The result was a system called designedGov. designedGov is a communication model and protocol.

In the first part of the course I came up with the specifications of the designedGov, and in the second, I created a mock designedGov implementation. After creating the mock implementation, I tested it's capabilities and useablility. From what I learned doing this, the specification was improved. This document will cover both parts of the course, but it will put more emphasis on the second as a report was already written about the first part.

== Introduction/Motivation/Objective

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is defined as follows.

[any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information., National Institue of Standards and Technology, NIST Special Publication 800-122]

designedGov is an attempt to improves how PII is accessed, shared and changed. In this definition, PII only encompasses individuals, but designedGov covers a larger scope and includes the "identifiable information" belonging not only to people, but to organizations. Not unlike an individual, an organization can have a name, a financial history, etc.

Nowadays, each agency (or more generally, organization) an individual interacts with has it's own identity authentication scheme and it's own "communication protocol". The identity authentication scheme is often insecure while the communication protocols are sometimes informal and and unclear. I'll provide some examples to clarify.

Think of withdrawing money from your bank's branch. Withdrawing money requires you present your bank card and possibly ID to the teller and request money. Here we can see the identity authentication scheme is the card and possibly some ID. The communication protocol isn't strictly formal as it involves talking with a human.

Another example is requesting medical records from a hospital. The identity scheme used by hospitals varies widely and is often very insecure. The communication protocol often isn't specified so a patient must often call to ask how to get their records. Requesting the documents and picking them up with some ID is often what is required, so this is the identity authentication scheme.

designedGov is a new digital communication model and protocol. The model and protocol are simple, flexible and secure with the goal that instead of users having to deal with many identification schemes and communication protocols, both often with low security and unclear/informal protocols they'll only need to use one.

Already, the government is implementing and rolling out digital services or digital front ends to their services. It would therefore be fair to ask why I feel the need to create this application. My answer is that the way government services evolve is very bad. They build upon previous iterations and all evolve mostly independently (and dependently in some bad ways) so that at the end of it you have a bunch of scattered systems where most of the design decisions weren't made to increase usability but to fit into the existing one. This is a pain for the end user as they need to not only learn how to use all these systems but it also makes them need to keep track of many different account details.

Organizations use user authentication which was never intended for the used purpose. This is called functionality creep and is a costly problem. An example is the Canadian social insurance number (SIN):

[quote]
_______
The SIN was created in 1964 to serve as a client account number in the administration of the Canada Pension Plan and Canada's varied employment insurance programs. In 1967, Revenue Canada (now the Canada Revenue Agency) started using the SIN for tax reporting purposes.
_______


The SIN has become the de facto national identification number, a purpose for which it was never meant to be used. The security flaws are glaringly obvious: the SIN must be passed around as plain text and with it someone can steal a person's identity. This has become such a problem that the Canadian government has recently decided to phase out physical SIN cards because of rampant identity theft. Instead of developing a new system as I am attempting, their solution is to rely on stricter privacy laws.

Different service providing organizations have created their own account details such as the student "Permanent Code" or the driver's license number. Problems with these are that once again they are inconvenient and aren't made with security in mind. I'll talk more about it later, but I feel that the people designing these systems don't know about modern cryptographic technology which should be a core tool in any system of this type.

Even if they were made with security and even cryptographic tools in mind though, a secure system requires the user has knowledge of how the security mechanisms work and what can be trusted. A system can be cryptographically secure but if a criminal impersonating a government official can call an unknowing user and convince them to divulge their account details, the system isn't secure. Each user having a single account for all services makes it easier for them to learn the knowledge needed to keep their information secure.
