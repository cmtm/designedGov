== Project abstract

The desginedGov protocols were roughly specified in the first part of this course. In this part, I'll devellop some demo programs to fill the various roles. The programs in question will be a Certificate Authority, a client interface and a few host applications. This demo programs will be simplified versions of the programs envisioned in the first part of the course. If time permits, I'll wrap these programs up in an ajax web app to allow a wide audience to try it and provide feedback.
