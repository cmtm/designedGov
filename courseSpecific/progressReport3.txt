== Supervisor meetings

I haven't met with my supervisor since the last progress report. It has only been two weeks since the last project report and we haven't had 
much time.

== Project Reading

I thought I had settled on what documentation I would read and what 
technologies I would use, but I came across many very relevant projects 
that attempt to provide solutions to the problem of managing access 
control to a user's resources. I've read some of the documentation, but 
I'll have to spend another week or two as there are many alternatives 
and they provide various functionality.

Some the projects in question:

- XACML
- PERMIS
- Shibboleth
- Higgins project
- User-Managed Access
- XRI
- SAML 

== Recent Progress

I've stopped working on the application description in order to explore 
the projects mentioned in the section above. There is a lot to read and 
many of the projects have overlapping functionality.

== Future Plans

I was planning to be well into working on the application description by 
now, but since I've found that these projects already implement much of the functionality I thought I would have to implement myself. Although 
reading about them will stall the project advancement in the short term, 
it has the potential to save a lot of time in the long run along with 
adding functionality and robustness.
